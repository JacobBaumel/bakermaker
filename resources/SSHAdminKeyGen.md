In this step, you will create the administrator SSH key. This key is needed for setup of the server, as well as 
when performing administrative actions later (ie creating/deleting repositories, managing users, etc.).

Important notes:
* There cannot be two users with the same name. Make sure the administrator name is unique from student names
* User names are up to 64 characters long
